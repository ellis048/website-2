I had a really hard time with learning SCSS. It really confusesd me with the examples and global usage
then I watched a video that explained that I can just use css and when I'm making sub codes I would need to nest it making it look cleaner.

I have separtated my animations and styles away from each other allowing it to be simpler for navigations 
I have nested my animations so it looks cleaner
The site where I get my colors is from cooler.co
I was going to add sound but there is no use for it right now
